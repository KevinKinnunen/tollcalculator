Planering:
1. Loop thru the dates while the vehicles drives thru. 

2. Send the vehicles.

3. Calc the fee everytime the vehicles drives thru including rush hour traffic.

4. CurrentFee += totalFee to save the price of fee.

5. If fee is higher than 60, set it to 60.

6. Make a method to test thru TollCalculatorTest.
